# COVID19 Data Exploration


## 2019.03.27

Just plotting data from NYT.

Looking for data on:
- Mobility (Unicast mobile data?)
- Dates of shelter-in-place / stay-at-home orders (currently just googling it and manually curating)

Questions:
- When are shelter-in-place orders most effective in the case trajectory (rate)?
- Which regions demonstrate reduction in mobility and/or cases following shelter-in-place orders? From talking to family, the midwest seems reluctant to take it seriously and decrease mobilization. This is also evident in unicast data on mobility
